# Web Developer Resources
Here are some tips and tricks for those who want to learn web development. I am not an expert and the advice here is not perfect, nor is
it set in stone. My only qualification for even offering this advice is that I have learned enough about web development to get paid for
it at some point.

### What is web development?
Web development is building websites using a mix of what's called front-end and back-end technologies. More on that later. Like anything
in programming, there are a billion ways to get from point A to point B, so all that matters in terms of getting employed is that you 
have SOME of the skills to accomplish what you'll need for that position. Some jobs are what's called "full-stack" which is a mixture of 
front-end and back-end technologies - this makes a lot of sense given how integrated some of the front/back-end languages are now, but
cynically, a full-stack position can also be a great way for a company to pay one person to do two jobs.

## Getting Started

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of the modern internet. You should learn these first. HTML (hyerptext markup
language) generally describes the content that is displayed on the webpage - text, images, lists, paragrahs, headings, etc... all fall 
under HTML. CSS (cascading style sheets) are what makes websites look like they do - the colors, fonts, text shadows, and even animations
are the responsilbity of CSS. JavaScript is a programming language (HTML and CSS are not "programming" languages in the same sense) that
has been around for 20-some years and is the best language for new developers because it's both relatively easy to understand and the job
market is FLUSH with JavaScript developer jobs. Note that JavaScript is not Java - Java is another unrelated programming language.

## Where Do I Learn All of This?
There are a billion resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am only going to list my favorites and explain how they can be 
helpful. I will try to warn you about things that are less helpful. For example:

### College!
College is awesome. It's also an insanely expensive investment that pretty much doesn't matter in the development field. Most computer 
science degrees will teach you things like C or C++, Java, and lots of algorithms and data structures (more on that later), and a ton of
theory and practical information about how computers work. This is all awesome and if I didn't have a stupid English degree, I would've 
done that, but I doubt I will ever go back for a computer science degree. That's OK though, because there are so many self-taught 
developers out there that it is perfectly acceptable for someone to get a job as a developer with no computer science degree or even a 
degree at all. 

### Web Developer Bootcamps
I did one of these through a company called Trilogy. It cost me $9,000 for a 3-month course. Bootcamps are usually run by companies and 
cost anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000. They are usually taught by web developers and can be extremely beneficial in getting started. They 
cover the basics and can focus on either the back-end or front-end. You will do a lot of projects, which is great for portfolios (more 
on that later). You will meet a lot of folks in similar life situations. I was 28 when I did my bootcamp and I figure I was part of the 
median age group for my class.
