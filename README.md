# Web Developer Resources
Here are some tips and tricks for those who want to learn web development. I am not an expert and the advice here is not perfect, nor is
it set in stone. My only qualification for even offering this advice is that I have learned enough about web development to get paid for
it at some point.

### What is web development?
Web development is building websites using a mix of what's called front-end and back-end technologies. More on that later. Like anything
in programming, there are a billion ways to get from point A to point B, so all that matters in terms of getting employed is that you 
have SOME of the skills to accomplish what you'll need for that position. Some jobs are what's called "full-stack" which is a mixture of 
front-end and back-end technologies - this makes a lot of sense given how integrated some of the front/back-end languages are now, but
cynically, a full-stack position can also be a great way for a company to pay one person to do two jobs.

## Getting Started

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of the modern internet. You should learn these first. HTML (hyerptext markup
language) generally describes the content that is displayed on the webpage - text, images, lists, paragrahs, headings, etc... all fall 
under HTML. CSS (cascading style sheets) are what makes websites look like they do - the colors, fonts, text shadows, and even 
animations are the responsilbity of CSS. JavaScript makes websites interactive. JS is a programming language (HTML and CSS are not 
"programming" languages in the same sense) that has been around for 20-some years and is the best language for new developers because 
it's both relatively easy to understand and the job market is FLUSH with JavaScript developer jobs. Note that JavaScript is not Java - 
Java is another unrelated programming language.

## Where Do I Learn All of This?
There are a billion resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am only going to list my favorites and explain how they can be 
helpful. I will try to warn you about things that are less helpful. For example:

### College!
College is awesome. It's also an insanely expensive investment that pretty much doesn't matter in the development field. Most computer 
science degrees will teach you things like C or C++, Java, and lots of algorithms and data structures (more on that later), and a ton of
theory and practical information about how computers work. This is all awesome and if I didn't have a stupid English degree, I would've 
done that, but I doubt I will ever go back for a computer science degree. That's OK though, because there are so many self-taught 
developers out there that it is perfectly acceptable for someone to get a job as a developer with no computer science degree or even a 
degree at all. 

### Web Developer Bootcamps
I did one of these through a company called Trilogy. It cost me $9,000 for a 3-month course. Bootcamps are usually run by companies and 
cost anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000. They are usually taught by web developers and can be extremely beneficial in getting started. They 
cover the basics and can focus on either the back-end or front-end. You will do a lot of projects, which is great for portfolios (more 
on that later). You will meet a lot of folks in similar life situations. I was 28 when I did my bootcamp and I figure I was part of the 
median age group for my class. 

### The Internet
This is where a majority of your learning will occur - Yes, that includes if you go to college or take a bootcamp. You will do almost 
all of your learning via resources on the Internet. Actually, let's just dive in.

#### Videos
Videos are my favorite way to learn. I like being able to hear someone explain something because I learn better that way. To get the 
most of video content, find ones where the creator actually writes the code and code along with them. You'll need a special type of
text editor, but more on that later.

I will list some of my favorite people here:

##### YouTube
I watch a lot of YouTubers, but I'm pretty picky because I like some decent production value, and it's always more fun when the 
project itself is cool. 
* [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU) has a great series on HTML and CSS. Just 
 do the first two videos, his HTML and CSS Crash Courses for Absolute Beginners, and then come back for the rest when you want to learn 
 more. His explanations are very simple the projects look nice, and you can get a good grasp of how things work.
 
* [Academind - Max Scwarzmuller](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rv_vo3TM3Byu71RYchX_l_) has another really great 
 playlist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript videos. Max is similar to Brad in that both of their channels cover such a wide array of 
 technologies and languages.
 
 ##### Udemy
Udemy gets a lot of hate because every course on there is like $200. Except, it's not, because they go on sale for $10 every other 
 week. I've gotten A LOT of value out of Udemy courses, because I tend to buy the ones that are extremely long. Here are some great 
 courses to start out with, but just wait until they're like ten bucks.
 
* [The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). Colt is awesome and weird, and he 
 does a great job covering a LOT of material. This is a 46+ hour course, so the bang for your buck is huge. He also has an advanced
 bootcamp that acts as a sequel to this one, and it goes over a lot of really useful stuff.
 
* [Accelerated JavaScript Training by Max Schwarzmuller](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-bootcamp-2016/). Yes, it's Max again. This
 is a great course for learning a lot about JS in a relatively short amount of time (a speedy 7 hours). This course covers functions,
 objects, arrays, and other key parts of JS (and many other languages).
 
 * [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/) and [Andrei Naegoie](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/) are two amazing
 instructors whose videos cover a wide range of web dev topics. Both of them are worth returning to once you've got the basics down. 
 They both have incredible courses on algorithms and data structures that are well worth taking. 
 
 #### Books
 Okay I'm going to be completely honest - I don't see the point in reading a book for something like web development, unless it has to
 do with general theory. Any book that contains examples of code is going to be out of date the week after it's printed. This is in 
 contrast with books about languages like C where you could probably pick up a book about C from 20 years ago and it would still be 
 relevant. There are a couple "web books" that I will point out:
 
 * [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) is a great book about some of the more confusing parts of the 
 language. Skim through it if you see something super confusing and want to know more.
 
 * [JavaScript for impatient programmers](http://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/). This is a bit more advanced, as the target audience is 
 people who already know how to use other programming languages, but it's got some really useful information on it.


## Now what?
Projects. Build projects. These can be anything, big and small, like a blog or a weather app, a Pok√©mon fan site, a todo list, etc... 
The possibilities are endless. Each project will help you learn. You WILL get frustrated, but that just means you're learning.

### Where to get help
Here are some resources that myself and others use: 
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This is a great resource when you have an issue you can't solve. I generally just Google 
whatever error I'm getting, and then just look for a Stack Overflow page where someone has a similar issue.

* Discord. Here are few Discord servers I use to get help with web dev stuff. 
** [Speak JS](https://discord.gg/Xdj4Yz)
** [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.me/coding) - this was started by Brad Traversy, I believe

**This is unfinished but I will keep adding to it.**

*Todo - portfolios, data structures and algorithsm, JavaScript frameworks and libraries.*
